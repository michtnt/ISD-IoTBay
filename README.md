# UTS - ISD

Introduction to Software Development Assignment 2

## Submission

Each group should assume the role of a Software Start-up Company. Each
group will submit the following two items for the IoTBay project:

**Working Software**: Working software application code will not be
submitted via Turnitin. The individually implemented (modules or features)
working software application code will be integrated and collated in a single
project Zip including single database. Submit ISD project working software
code files (source and executable) with readme file (how to deploy and run
the software) as a single Zip file in the UTSOnline Assignment 2/ “Working
Software Code Submission” folder using your relevant workshop link before
05/06/2020 11:55 PM AEST. You can submit the software only once. You
must not make any changes once the software code is submitted. If you
make any changes after the submission due date, then the late
assignment rules will be applied.

**Report**: Each group will submit a softcopy (Microsoft Word File or PDF) of
the group report containing individual group member contributions. The
individual student contributions or parts will be highlighted (with their names
and student ids) and collated in a single group deliverable file for submission
and assessment (group submission but individual assessment). Each
individual contribution will provide the (1) brief description of the assigned
software application feature or module, (2) non-functional aspects, and (3)
software testing results with executed tests and (4) defect log including (5)
individual contribution logbook/timesheets via Turnitin before 05/06/2020
11:55 PM AEST. Use the Project - Assessment item 2 Turnitin link (View/
Complete) in the UTSOnline Assignment 2 folder for submitting your
assignment.

Your both software code and report submission files title/name must follow
the following naming pattern.

Your workshop activity number–group id

For instance, if your Wrk1 activity number is 02 (see timetable for your
activity) and group id is G1 then your submission file title/ name must be
worded as 02-G1. From each group only one student (project leader) should
submit the assignment on the behalf of the whole group. 
You do not need to put the student ids of all the group members on the file title/ name. You must
check Turnitin report and ensure that your work does not contain plagiarism.
You may submit your report to Turnitin many times before the submission
due date. Final Turnitin reports can be used as evidence by the teaching staff
if plagiarism is suspected in an assignment and will be dealt as per University
rules. Do not allow anyone to copy your solution – this is considered
misconduct; all miscreants will receive a mark of 0, at best for the
assignment and will be dealt as per University rules. You may be required
to provide the hard or soft copy of the assignment anytime during the
semester.

## Method
The assignment will be done in a group (preferably in the same workshop
and same group as for assignment 1). Group size should be limited to 4 and
no more than 6 students (enrolment numbers and situation-specific
circumstance will dictate the actual size of the groups). Groups were formed
for assignment 1 (during Weeks 1-4) and for any reason(s) you want to
change the group for assignment 2, then it is solely your responsibility to
make other arrangements and find another alternative group who is willing to
accept you. You cannot change the group once you have started the
assignment 2 (Week 7 onwards). This is a group assignment, however
each student in the group needs to implement (code) and test end-to-end
(as per MVC architecture layers) a complete working (free of defects)
software feature or module as their individual contribution. If the overall
software works but an individual’s implemented software feature or module
does not work according to the requirements, then that individual will
receive zero mark for this assignment. This way other members in the groups
will not be affected by the no or poor performance of an individual. You
must respect other students in the same group, different groups and teaching
staff. If you have any group issues, then you must inform your workshop
tutor as soon as possible and well before (at least 3 weeks or earlier) the
assignment submission or due date. Group assignment issues reported
on or after the assignment submission date may not be considered.
There will be zero tolerance for any academic and non-academic
misconduct. See University Rules, Subject Outline and Academic
Misconduct section of this brief for details.

## Objectives

Subject objectives: 1, 2, 3,4 and 5
1. Investigate and solve software development problems with minimal
supervision.
2. Determine and balance the competing goals of software development
activities within their constraints
3. Plan and manage a software development task to create, modify or extend
a software feature or function to completion within the task constraints.
4. Apply sound software engineering practices to successfully create, modify
or extend a software feature or function.
5. Clearly Communicate software and task information to interested
stakeholders

## Task

You are required to develop a web software application for Online IoTBay.
The software should be developed using agile practices and following and
MVC architecture designed and planned in assignment 1. You can adjust
the above in consultation and approval from your tutor during the
assignment 2. This assessment task will require a team of 4-6 students to
produce, submit and present a group report (comprises of individual
contributions), small working software application (comprises of
individually implemented and tested software features or modules) and
individual contribution logbooks/ timesheets for release 1 (see minimum
viable product section) for Online IoTBay. Based on the plan, software
requirements, architecture, and design (submitted for Assessment Items 1)
for release 1 (minimum viable product), each individual student in the
group shall:

• Working Software Application: Each student in a group will
implement and test the assigned (as agreed between the group
members and approved by the tutor as a product owner) feature or
module of the small software application; and
• Report: Each student in a group will provide the brief description of
the assigned software application feature or module, non-functional 
aspects, and software testing results with executed tests and defect
log.

The individual student contributions or parts will be collated in a group
deliverable for submission and assessment (group submission but individual
assessment). The deliverables of this assessment task also include a
compulsory oral/visual presentation (no PowerPoint slides) of the
individually implemented working software application during the scheduled
assignment assessment or review session (showcase), individual contribution
logbooks/ timesheets and working software code implemented – as per
Subject Weekly Schedule. Any whole team or individual student who
failed to appear and present in these compulsory assignment assessment
and review sessions (Showcase) will receive zero (0) as a final individual
mark. Each ISD project team needs to nominate a project manager/ lead who
will submit the assignment 2 (software and report) on the behalf of the whole
group or team.

## Summary

Each group shall explore different ways of ensuring quality outcomes through the agile
development and testing approach. This can be supported through a set of software
development and testing tools. Please note that the work done in the Assignments 1 is a
starting point for students to produce the working software and report in Assignment 2.
Working software must be developed and tested for release 1 of IoTBay (minimum
viable product). Students must get feedback on their work-in-progress project from their
tutors (product owners) during the workshop sessions before formal submission.
Note: It is recommended that the essential functionality of the assignment will be
implemented using the web technologies and techniques taught in this subject (e.g. Java,
JSP, JDBC, Java DB). You are not allowed to use any other technology or framework.
You can use CSS or bootstrap framework for web pages and user interface. 

## Minimum Viable Product

You have already implemented the initial prototype in assignment 1 (prototype). It was the
starting point of the web application and provided the options of login and register to users
(without database connectivity). It should provide further implementations, pages and links
for other features (see table below) with appropriate navigation between pages (view),
controller and model including database tables and sample data. In consultation with your
tutor during Assignment 1 Showcase, you should confirm/ finalise the features from
the following table (e.g. 1 feature per team member) for the minimum viable product,
update the backlog, assign the individual feature to the team member and align the
user stories captured in assignment 1. Features 01, 02, 03 and 04 are mandatory and
foundational features for the minimum viable product (release 1). If you are 4 people in
a group, then you will include these mandatory 4 features for the implementation and testing
for release 1. For 6 people in a group, you will select these mandatory 4 features plus any of
the other 2 features of your choice from the list to ensure that each student in a group has
the responsibility to implement an individual end to end feature using MVC. Special
circumstances or group size (<3) may change the group work in consultation with the tutor
and subject coordinator. Professional software development and learning requires team
effort. The purpose of the following key features table is to teach you and demonstrate
how to systematically organise features (e.g. data capturing/data management to BI &
reporting). You can apply these learnings to other Industry and University projects.
